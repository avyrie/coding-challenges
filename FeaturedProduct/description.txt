A store selling clothes chooses which item to feature by what sells the best the day before.  Write a function that takes in an array representing all items sold the day before and returns the suitable featured product of the day as a string. If two products are tied for the most sold, those top products are sorted alphabetically with the last product being the featured product for the next day.

Example: 
featuredProduct(['red', 'green', 'red', 'orange', 'black', 'black']) // => returns "red"
