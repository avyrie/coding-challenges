Write a function that takes in a non-empty array and returns an array containing the product of every other number in the original array besides the number that is in the original index.

Example: 
arrayOfProducts([1, 6, 3, 4]) // => returns [72, 12, 24, 18]

6*3*4 = 72
1*3*4 = 12
1*6*4 = 24
1*6*3 = 18
