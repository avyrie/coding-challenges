Write a function that prints all numbers starting at 1 up to and including a given argument. No matter the argument, the function should at least print each number starting at 1 up to and including 5.


Example:
atLeastFive(7) // => returns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
atLeastFive(3) // => returns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
